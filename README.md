## About me

Hi there, I'm Katherine!

🎒📚 I studied Genetics, Cell Biology and Development and Microbiology at the University of Minnesota 🧬🔬

💻🖱️ I am working as a researcher and trying to learn as much as I can about bioinformatics and proteomics 🤔🦠

🍂❤️ My favorite season is autumn. I love wearing oversized hoodies when it gets chilly out :D
