## About me

Hi there, I'm Katherine!

🎒📚 I studied Genetics, Cell Biology and Development and Microbiology at the University of Minnesota 🧬🔬

💻🖱️ I am working as a researcher on the [Galaxy-P team](https://galaxyp.org/) and trying to learn as much as I can about bioinformatics and proteomics, while creating [Galaxy-based workflows](https://galaxyproject.org/) and [online training materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) that promote community adoption of bioinformatic workflows and tools 🤔🦠

🍂❤️ My favorite season is autumn. I love wearing oversized hoodies when it gets chilly out :D


## My work

🌟	Current project: Developing  a bioinformatic pipeline for mass spectrometry-based analysis of microbial immunopeptides

◾ Aid in data visualization and interpretation and tool development for analytical workflows

◾ Created tutorial materials to encourage community adoption and usage of clinical metaproteomics and neoantigen workflows

◾ Refined scientific writing skills through preparation and publication of two peer-reviewed articles

◾ Galaxy Training Materials: [My GTN Contributions](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/katherine-d21/)
